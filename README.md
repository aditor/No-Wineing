We developed a dynamic AND safe drinking web app to inform players of their blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels throughout the game, and help them make responsible decisions.

BAC levels change in real time for each person, based on their gender, weight and beverage type.

Each time a person drinks, their BAC levels will automatically update with a percentage of their life-threatening limit personalized to their gender and weight.
